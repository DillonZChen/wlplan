To generate the documentation locally for this package with Sphinx, clone the repository and then run the following commands:

    cd docs/
    pip install -r docs-requirements.txt

The full documentation can only be generated if the installation was successful. It can be viewed by opening `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser.
